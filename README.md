# Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
Predicting customer churn is critical for businesses to retain valuable customers and reduce revenue loss. This project leverages machine learning to identify customers at risk of leaving, providing actionable insights to guide retention strategies.

This end-to-end project includes data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and performance evaluation using industry-standard ML techniques.
